			<h2> Research </h2>
			<p> According to CNN news, a recent study revealed that a single liter of water contained an average of 240,000 plastic particles from seven different types of plastics. Among these particles, 90% were classified as nanoplastics and the remaining 10% were microplastics. Experts say that nanoplastics, measuring 1,000th the average width of a human hair, have the ability to go through the human tissues of the digestive tract or lungs into the bloodstream, spreading chemicals that could be harmful throughout the body and into cells. </p>

			<p> According to Forbes, an earlier study conducted by the State University of New York in Fredonia in 2018 found that microplasitcs existed in 93% of bottled water from the selected 259 bottled water across nine countries. </p>
